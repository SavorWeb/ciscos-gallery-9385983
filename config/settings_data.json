For us, this is a way of sharing history so that it may be continually enjoyed by others – sparking intrigue and appreciation across generations rather than decaying in storage. We sell to collectors and any individual wishing to procure a part the past. A vast majority of our inventory relates to America and the Old West; however, we also occasionally carry exceptional pieces from throughout the world. Our e-commerce site represents only a small portion of the total number of items we have in inventory at the gallery.",

Our experience extends from individual items, to lifetime collections, and often entire estates. We would be happy to review and quote a charge for an appraisal of your item or collection. If outside of our expertise, we will refer you to a more appropriate appraiser. Our services are fee-based and offered on a “piece-by-piece” basis for individual items and on a “time and expenses” basis for larger collections.",
